    <h3> Smartphones Do Not Have A Place In The Classroom </h3>
    <p> I think this, because as mature students, they'd probably be fine, but students are never mature when it comes to phones. Year 7 all the way through Year 13. The temptation is always there to game, text, and go on Social Media. We're not responsible, or mature enough to handle that kind of thing. Isn't that why our online game access is blocked? Because the school doesn't trust us not to use the wi-fi on our laptops to game. Also, they just don't serve any purpose. You don't NEED your phone in class, anything you can do on your phone, you can do on your laptop on a much bigger screen. Others may argue otherwise, how we need them for this and that, but we've lasted this long without them haven't we? All they want to do, are the things I listed above. Another disadvantage, is that kids not as rich as others, probably those on Scholarship may not have access to a phone, or if they do, have a $20 one to be made fun of. </p>
